#In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence
# (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
# syntax = for variable in iterable:
                #rest of the code
#example - fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# name = 'Abhishek'
# for i in name:
#   print(i)
#   if(i =="b"):
#     print("This is something special!")

# colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"]
# for color in colors:
#   print(color)
#   for i in color:
#     print(i)

# for k in range(5):
#   print(k + 1)

# for k in range(1, 20001):
#   print(k)


for k in range(1, 12, 3):
    print(k)
